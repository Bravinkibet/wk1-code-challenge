//Speed Detector
//If the speed is less than 70, it returns the string "ok".
//If the speed is 70 or more, it calculates the number of points by subtracting 70 from the speed, dividing by 5, and rounding up to the nearest whole number using Math.ceil.
//It then checks if the calculated points exceed 12. If so, it returns the string "License suspended".
//If the points do not exceed 12, it returns a string indicating the number of points.
